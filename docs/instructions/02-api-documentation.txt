Documenting your Endpoints
Documenting your endpoints is critical so that other users understand how to use the API.

For this project, you will need to provide detailed documentation of your API endpoints in your project's README.md file. The documentation for each API endpoint must include:

URL
request parameters
response body.
Use the example below as a reference.
